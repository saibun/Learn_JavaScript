		//splice method--> in splice method first you have to say index position, then how many elements want to delete, and then which element want to add. In array A ([165, 14, 11, 2]) i want to start form index position 1 and want to delete 2 items and want to add 1000,1001,1010,1011 
		let result=A.splice(1,2,1000,1001,1010,1011);
		//result will be {165,1000,1001,1010,1011,2}
		console.log(A)
